# Changelog

## 26.11

* New endpoint `GET /1.0/metrics`: Prometheus metrics, without authentication.
  It is served by the `metrics` plugin, disabled by default; enable it with
  `enabled_plugins: {metrics: true}`.

## 26.09

* Requests to wazo-auth now default to `localhost:80`, through nginx.

## 26.08

* New `rest_api.min_threads` option: threads kept ready at all times.
  `max_threads` is now a ceiling the pool grows to under load, not a fixed
  thread count.

## 26.02

* `POST` and `PATCH` request bodies to endpoints accepting JSON payload are systematically parsed as JSON, with or without a proper `Content-Type` header;
* `POST` and `PATCH` requests to endpoints accepting JSON payload and which are missing a body now return a `400` status response;
  previously those invalid requests could be treated as valid when Content-Type was missing and bodies were not parsed;

## 23.01

* Changed the following bus configuration keys in config file:

  * `exchange_name` value was changed to 'wazo-headers'
  * `exchange_type` key was removed
  * `exchange_durable` key was removed
  * `startup_connection_tries` key was removed
  * `startup_connection_delay` key was removed

## 20.05

* Deprecate SSL configuration
